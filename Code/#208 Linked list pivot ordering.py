"""
Given a linked list of numbers and a number k, partition the linked list so that all nodes less than k come before nodes greater than or equal to k.

For example, given the linked list 5 -> 1 -> 8 -> 0 -> 3 and k = 3, the solution could be 1 -> 0 -> 5 -> 8 -> 3. (So the position of the number of the pivot is irrelevant as long as it follows the rules).
